PACKAGES:
1.FILE I/O:
    a.(os.file) objects are used for file manipulations. (os.File) objects are also called filehandles.
    b.open function which is in os package is used to open files in Go
    c.ReadFile() in the io/ioutil package is used to read the file.This method returns []byte array of read bytes.
    d.file.WriteString method can be used to write to the file.
    e.defer file.close() right after opening the file to make sure that the file is closed
       as soon as the function completes.
    f.inputFile, inputError = os.Open("input.dat") results in an error.
       (If a file does not exists or the program has not the sufficient rights to open the file then)
    Example:
    package main
    import (
       "os"
       "log"
       "io/ioutil"
       "fmt"
    )
    func main() {
       file, err := os.Create("file.txt")
       if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
       }
       file.WriteString("Hi... there")
       file.Close()
       stream, err:= ioutil.ReadFile("file.txt")
       if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
       }
       readString := string(stream)
       fmt.Println(readString)
    }

2.Http Packages:
    a.Net/http is a library package used to build web applications
    b.HandelFunc() function which routes the incoming request to its corresponding function.
    c.The ListenAndServe function is used to create a resource server which listens to the provided port.
